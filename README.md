👋 Hi, I’m @collinbartley (but you can call me Collin)

I'm a web developer based in S/E Michigan. I love front-end development, but also occaisonally spend time on API and database work. 
Design is my passion- be it UI/UX, components, systems, structures, whatever else. Thinking through abstract problems and creatively designing elegant and accesible solutions is my favorite part about what I do.

I currently work as a full-stack engineer for bigbear.ai

A couple fun-facts:
- I love baseball
- I'm left handed

A couple hot-takes:
- Writing CSS is a blast
- Black coffee is the only way
- 65 and partly cloudy is the best weather possible
